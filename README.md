RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company that has produced many super-hit movies. The company has generally released movies for the Indian audience, but they plan to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

 

The production company wants to plan every move analytically based on data and has approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past 3 years. You have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights to help the company start their new project.

You are a data analyst and an SQL expert. You have to use SQL to analyse the given data and give recommendations to RSVP Movies based on your insights. For your convenience, the analytics process has been divided into four segments, where each segment leads to significant insights from different combinations of tables. The questions in each segment with business objectives are listed in the script below. You have to write the solution code below every question and submit the same SQL script file with the solution in the ‘Submission’ segment.
About the Assignment
Where do I get the data from?

You can get detailed information about the data set and database creation in the next segment.

 

Where do I write the code?

The SQL script file above contains all the tasks you need to perform. You must write the code for each task/question below the question itself.

 

How do I submit the assignment?

Once you write the codes in the question script file, the same script file should be submitted in the ‘Submission’ segment.

 

Some tips before starting the assignment

Go through the data thoroughly before starting the assignment. It will give you a good sense of what all the columns represent, which is a good practice to follow before proceeding with the analysis. You should download the database script and run it in your local system.
Read through each of the instructions carefully, identify the task to be performed and only then proceed to write the required code. Do not perform any incorrect analysis or look for information that is not needed for the assignment. The solution output should be in the expected format if given in the question.
Try using appropriate aliases for the variable names. Avoid using names like ABC, ABC, etc.
Always try to write optimised codes. Use appropriate tables and joins as per the questions asked.
There are some checkpoints given in the question SQL script provided. Keep your eye out for them as they are useful pieces of information that you can use to check if the result you have obtained after performing a particular task is correct.
 

Submissions Required
SQL script file: This is the question SQL script file given with the final codes (answers) written in it. It will be your solution file.
Executive summary: Write the executive summary consisting of the important insights derived from the data and some recommendations to RSVP Movies for their project. Ensure that this summary does not exceed 250 words, and save it as a PDF file.

You were already introduced to the data set in the optional practice assignment of the Data Modelling module. You might have created the tables and inserted the values for the entire schema. If you have completed this, you can verify your code and database from the SQL script file given at the bottom of the page.

 

For those who did not attempt the optional data modelling assignment, download the data set given below and follow the listed steps to insert the values for the entire schema.

 

Note: It is highly recommended to create the SQL database on your local machine using the data set given below. However, note that this part is optional and will not carry any grades, and if you wish, you can directly run the SQL script given at the end of this segment to load the data set.
